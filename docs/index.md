## Introduction

This website contains installation guides to setup primary software packages and development infrastructure for **Mac** Workstations. Maintained and Curated by [PughLab](https://pughlab.mbg.cornell.edu/).

## Infrastructure Details

The lab takes advantage of [GALAXY](https://galaxyproject.github.io/) to create data analysis & visualization pipelines for large-scale data processing on the [ACI-ICS](https://ics.psu.edu/about/) clusters and also leverages [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) resources for compute requirements.

For day to day bioinformatics, install & start using [Script Manager.](https://github.com/CEGRcode/scriptmanager/releases)

|ICS-ACI Resource URL|

|[Account Setup](https://ics.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/) |
|[User's Guide](https://ics.psu.edu/computing-services/ics-aci-user-guide/)|

_Make sure you are added to the PughLab ACI allocations and relevant group space once you get an ACI account._

## Software Stacks

Below are some the Web development stacks being used in the lab.

|Project | Abbreviation | Stack |
|----|----|----|
| Yeast Epigenome Project | YEP | MERN |
| Protein Capture Reagent Program Validation | PCRP | MERN |
| Platform for Epigenetic and Genomic Research | PEGR | [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/), [Grails](https://grails.org/), [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) |

- MERN Stack is made up of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- For more project repositories, go to PughLab's [GitHub](https://github.com/CEGRcode)

#### Development Tools

- Install the missing package manager for macOS : [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/)
- Command line tools using Xcode, paste this command in a terminal :  `xcode-select --install`
- For `Python3` & `Python2.x` development, download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Install `Java8.x` and `Java JDK` before you download the latest release of [ScriptManager](https://github.com/CEGRcode/scriptmanager/releases)
