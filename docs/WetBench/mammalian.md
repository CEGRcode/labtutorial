## General Notes

***

### Environmental Health and Safety Requirements

All biological material is considered a biohazard until it has been crosslinked with formaldehyde. All waste (tips, paper towels, gloves) associated with cell culture processing prior to crosslinking must be disposed of in biohazard waste bags and autoclaved after processing is complete.

All solutions and surfaces that made contact with biological material prior to crosslinking must be neutralized with 10% bleach (final concentration for solutions) in order for it to be poured down the sink. Solutions must incubate with 10% bleach for at least 30 minutes under a chemical hood before decanting. Surfaces must be wiped down with 10% bleach solution, followed by water, and then 70% ethanol.

### Performing a Cell Count

Cell counts are performed before passaging and harvesting cells to ascertain the culture's cell density so that they can be properly split or harvested and then cryogenically frozen in well-defined aliquot sizes for downstream processing.

Note: This guide assumes all necessary equipment and consumables have already been wiped down with 70% ethanol and placed in the biological safety hood.

1. If not already done, pipette 1 mL of media from cell culture flask using a 5 mL serological pipette and dispense into a 15 mL conical.
	* Be sure to keep lid of flask in-hand and face-down while transferring media to prevent contamination.
	* Note: Adherent cells (like HepG2 line) must be trypsinized before taking an 	aliquot for a cell count.
2. Remove the 15 mL conical from the biological safety hood in its tube rack, and bring it to the <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AMEX1000#/AMEX1000" target="_blank">EVOS Microscope</a>.
3. Locate the hemocytometer and the glass cover slip, and place the glass cover slip on top of the hemocytometer platform in the center as shown below. ![Hemocytometer Diagram](./images/94_hemocytometer.PNG)
4. Pipette 20 uL of the cell-containing media into one of the hemocytometer's chambers using a p200 pipette.
5. Turn on the EVOS Microscope and position the hemocytometer so the chamber's grid containing the liquid can be visualized.
	* Note: You may have to adjust the lens to the correct magnification--if using 	correct magnification, you should see 9 large squares.
6. Cells will be counted from the large squares in each of the corners (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, see below).
	* Some cells may appear to be touching the edges of the squares or be straddling the edge--only count those touching the top and left edges of the square, and 		exclude those touching the bottom and right edges. (In principle, can be any two sides chosen to accept or exclude).
	* Count the cells using a manual cell counter and record the numbers for each 	corner square. ![Hemocytometer Grid Diagram](./images/93_hemocytometer-squares-to-count.png)
7. Multiply the mean of the cell counts by 10^4 to convert the number's units to cells/mL
	* Each large square has a volume of 10^-4 cm^3, and 1 cm^3 = 1 mL.
8. Place a Kimwipe down on the lab bench and move the hemocytometer to the bench.
9. Remove the glass coverslip, spray both sides with 70% ethanol, and wipe it down with a separate Kimwipe.
10. Spray the hemocytometer platform with 70% ethanol and wipe it down with a separate Kimwipe.
11. Discard the 15 mL conical containing the remainder of the cell-containing media in the biohazard receptacle.

	* While the cells are spinning, obtain a dewar of liquid nitrogen (see below for dewar appearance). <p>&nbsp;</p> <img align="center" width="200" height="200" src="../images/65_liquid_nitrogen_benchtop_dewar.jpg">
27. Decant the supernatant and re-suspend each pellet with 4.5 mL cold 1X PBS w/ CPI.
	* Pool all solutions into a new pre-labeled 50 mL conical.
	* Calculate how much more 1X PBS w/ CPI to add to make the concentration equal to 50*10^6 cells/mL.
	* e.g. Regular Harvest: Final cell concentration from cell count = 6.7 * 10^5 cells/mL * 1500 mL cell-containing solution = 1.005 * 10^9 cells. 50 * 10^6 cells/mL = 1.005 * 10^9 cells / x mL --> x mL = 1.005 * 10^9 cells / 50 * 10^6 cells/mL = 20.1 mL. So, must add 6.6 mL more.
28. Transfer 1 mL to each of the pre-labeled 2 mL conical screw cap tubes and spin for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C.
29. Decant supernatant and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen.
30. Store tubes at -80˚C in box labeled with cell line, crosslinking conditions, and quenching conditions.
31. Pour concentrated bleach into 4 L beaker containing media waste from centrifugation to 10% final concentration and allow to incubate for 30 minutes before decanting down sink.
32. Wash all plasticware for mammalian processing with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Procter-Gamble-608-25574-Ivory-Detergent/dp/B00PKHS9WO" target="_blank">Ivory soap</a> two times with tap water, and then rinse once with dH2O.

### Creating Cell Stocks

10% glycerol stock of media, spin down cells, re-suspend in 10% glycerol media, slow descent to -80C, transfer to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.

### Harvesting

*Note: This protocol is written under the assumption that the user will be harvesting seven T-175 flasks that have reached 80% confluency.*

Fast-temp a <a href="https://online-shop.eppendorf.us/US-en/Centrifugation-44533/Centrifuges-44534/Centrifuge-5810-5810R-PF-240994.html" target="_blank">Eppendorf table-top centrifuge</a> and a <a href="https://online-shop.eppendorf.us/US-en/Centrifugation-44533/Centrifuges-44534/Centrifuge-5418R-PF-240995.html" target="_blank">Eppendorf microcentrifuge</a> to 4˚C.
5. Prepare one 50 mL conical containing 50 mL <a href="https://cegrcode.github.io/GeneralLab/buffers/#1x-pbs-1-l" target="_blank">1X PBS</a> and 100 µL <a href="https://cegrcode.github.io/GeneralLab/buffers/#complete-protease-inhibitor-edta-free-cpi-1-ml" target="_blank">CPI</a> (2 µL/mL) in an ice bucket.
6. For the biological safety hood, prepare/gather the following things:
	* Seven 1.29 mL aliquots of 32% formaldehyde in 15 mL conical tubes
	* Seven 9.5 mL aliquots of 9.5 mL 3 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 in 15 mL conical tubes

	* Conical tube rack
	* Preset timer with two settings: A count-up setting and a 10-minute timer
7. Once the hood is finished with its UV cycle, wipe down all of the aforementioned items with 70% ethanol and place them under the hood.
	* Also fetch the T-175 flasks from the incubator, as well as the media and the Trypsin, being sure to wipe them down carefully with 70% ethanol, and place them under the hood.
8. Working on one T-175 flask at a time, transfer 5 mL of media from the flask into a corresponding 1.29 mL aliquot of formaldehyde with a 5 mL serological pipette and mix well.
	* Transfer the solution back into the first T-175 flask using the same 5 mL serological tip and start the timer's counting up feature.
	* Gently mix by rocking the flask back and forth and repeat every couple of minutes.
	* Repeat the same procedure for the other flasks, being sure to add the formaldehyde mixture at each sequential minute mark (i.e. second one starts at one minute).
	* Total crosslinking time should be 10 minutes for each flask.
9. As each flask reaches its 10-minute mark, pour the 9.5 mL aliquots of 3 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 into the flask.
	* Start a separate count-up timer and gently mix by rocking back and forth.
	* The quenching step should last 5 minutes.
	* Repeat this for each flask as it reaches its 10-minute crosslinking time.
10. As the quenching reaction reaches its 5-minute point, for each flask, decant the solution by pouring into 500 mL plastic beaker, and add 40 mL of 1X PBS with a separate 50 mL serological tip for each flask.
	* Repeat the 1X PBS wash by pouring off old PBS and using the same serological tip from before to add 40 mL of new PBS.
11. Decant the old PBS into the 500 mL plastic beaker and transfer 12 mL of Trypsin using a 25 mL serological tip into the first T-175 flask.
	* Start the 10-minute timer and pipette 12 mL of Trypsin into the remaining T-175 flasks as quickly as possible, using a new 25 mL serological tip for each flask/
	* Move the T-175 flasks into the incubator after wiping down with 70% ethanol.
12. Once the timer goes off, remove the flasks from he hood and wipe each one down with 70% ethanol before placing back under the hood.
13. Pipette 12 mL of fresh media into each flask using a fresh 25 mL serological tip for each flask.
	* Pipette up and down ten times or so to dislodge the cells.
	* Using a p200 pipette, remove 30 µL from each flask and dispense into a corresponding 0.5 mL tube.
	* Transfer the 24 mL of cell-containing media into the four pre-labeled 50 mL conicals, 6 mL into each conical, with the same 25 mL serological tip for each flask (each conical should have 42 mL of cell-containing media).
14. Spin the cells in the pre-cooled table-top centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C.
	* Perform a <a href="https://cegrcode.github.io/GeneralLab/mammalian/#performing-a-cell-count" target="_blank">cell count</a> while the cells are spinning.
15. When the spin is complete, decant the supernatant and re-suspend the first pellet in 20 mL of chilled 1X PBS w/ CPI using a 25 mL serological tip.
	* Use that same 20 mL to re-suspend the remaining pellets, such that all pellets are pooled into one 50 mL conical.
16. Spin the cells for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C in the same table-top centrifuge.
	* Obtain a small amount of liquid nitrogen in the bench-top dewar while the cells are spinning (see below for dewar appearance). <p>&nbsp;</p> <img align="center" width="200" height="200" src="../images/65_liquid_nitrogen_benchtop_dewar.jpg">
17. Decant the supernatant once the cells are finished spinning, and re-suspend the pellet in the requisite amount of 1X PBS + CPI to obtain a cell concentration of 50 M cells/mL.
	* e.g. For the seven harvested flasks, the densities were all calculated to be 6.25*10^5 cells/mL. 6.25*10^5 cells/mL/flask * 24 mL = 15*10^6 cells/flask. 15*10^6 cells/flask * 7 flasks = 105*10^6 cells.
	* To get 50*10^6 cells/mL, need 105*10^6 cells / 50*10^6 cells/mL = 2.1 mL
	* If pellet volume is 500 µL, need to add 1.6 mL of 1X PBS + CPI.
18. Split the re-suspended cell volume into 1 mL aliquots in the pre-labeled 2 mL screw cap tubes.
	* Spin for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C in the pre-chilled microcentrifuge.
19. Decant the supernatant when the spin has concluded and toss the tubes in the liquid nitrogen dewar to flash-freeze the cell pellets.
20. Transfer these tubes to a pre-labeled box in the -80˚C.
21. Turn off all centrifuges.
22. Remove all items from the hood.
	* Any remaining media should be placed at 4˚C and any remaining Trypsin should be placed at -20˚C.
	* All used serological tips and conical tubes in contact with cell culture media should be placed in the biohazard receptacle.
	* Empty media bottles should be incubated with 10% bleach for 30 minutes before disposing down sink and throwing away bottle in biohazard receptacle.
	* Interior of hood should be wiped down with 70% ethanol and the hood's UV light should be turned on before leaving.
23. Remaining T-175 flask should be split the following day by completing the <a href="https://cegrcode.github.io/GeneralLab/mammalian/#splitting_1" target="_blank">splitting</a> protocol.

	* Transfer two pellets to a pre-labeled 50 mL conical tube (labeled w/ CH12) for a total of 40 mL per 50 mL conical tube.
26. Spin the 50 mL conicals in the tabletop centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C.
	* While the cells are spinning, obtain a dewar of liquid nitrogen (see below for dewar appearance). <p>&nbsp;</p> <img align="center" width="200" height="200" src="../images/65_liquid_nitrogen_benchtop_dewar.jpg">
27. Decant the supernatant and re-suspend each pellet with 4.5 mL cold 1X PBS w/ CPI.
	* Pool all solutions into a new pre-labeled 50 mL conical.
	* Calculate how much more 1X PBS w/ CPI to add to make the concentration equal to 50*10^6 cells/mL.
	* e.g. Regular Harvest: Final cell concentration from cell count = 6.7 * 10^5 cells/mL * 1500 mL cell-containing solution = 1.005 * 10^9 cells. 50 * 10^6 cells/mL = 1.005 * 10^9 cells / x mL --> x mL = 1.005 * 10^9 cells / 50 * 10^6 cells/mL = 20.1 mL. So, must add 6.6 mL more.
28. Transfer 1 mL to each of the pre-labeled 2 mL conical screw cap tubes and spin for 5 minutes at 1500*g and 4˚C.
29. Decant supernatant and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen.
30. Store tubes at -80˚C in box labeled with cell line, crosslinking conditions, and quenching conditions.
31. Pour concentrated bleach into 4 L beaker containing media waste from centrifugation to 10% final concentration and allow to incubate for 30 minutes before decanting down sink.
32. Wash all plasticware for mammalian processing with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Procter-Gamble-608-25574-Ivory-Detergent/dp/B00PKHS9WO" target="_blank">Ivory soap</a> two times with tap water, and then rinse once with dH20.

See below for pictorial description of a single pass through a needle). <p>&nbsp;</p> <img align="left" width="300" height="300" src="../images/79_full_needle.png"> <img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="../images/78_empty_needle.png"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
	* Replace the solution on the rototorque and incubate for another 10 minutes at 4˚C.
	* Note: If processing in a 15 or 50 mL conical tube, use lab tape found at benches to affix tube to rototorque; otherwise, just slide 2 mL screw cap tubes into slots on rototorque attachment.
7. If not already prepared, fill requisite number of <a href="https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4675790/falcon-centrifuge-tubes-polystyrene-sterile-corning" target="_blank">15 mL Falcon polystyrene tubes</a> with 300 µL of <a href="https://biospec.com/product/zirconia-silica-beads" target="_blank">0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads</a> using the yellow 150 µL scoop.
	* Note: 300 µL of beads refers to filling 15 mL Falcon polystyrene tube up to third tick from bottom of the tube, corresponding to 300 µL (see below). <p>&nbsp;</p> <img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="../images/80_15mL_polystyrene.jpg"> <p>&nbsp;</p>
	* Note: Maximum sonication volume is 1 mL, so prepare enough tubes to account for entire volume being processed (e.g. processing 250 M cells, need 10 mL to obtain concentration of 25 M cells/mL --> prepare ten 15 mL Falcon polystyrene tubes).
8. Spin nuclei at 3148*g, 4˚C for 5 minutes if processing in a 15 or 50 mL conical tube.
	* Spin at 9391*g. 4˚C for 3 minutes if processing in a 2 mL screw cap tubes.
9. Aspirate supernatant and re-suspend pellet in volume of RIPA Buffer + CPI required to maintain cell concentration below 25 M cells/mL.
	* For 15 or 50 mL conical processing, add RIPA Buffer + CPI by serological pipette, break pellet up with serological pipette, and then pass the solution through a 21G needle twice (one in and one out) to homogenize the solution.
	* For 2 mL screw cap tubes, use P1000 to re-suspend pellets in RIPA Buffer + CPI.
10. Incubate on rototorque for 20 minutes at 4˚C.
11. Centrifuge at 3148*g, 4˚C for 5 minutes if processing in a 15 or 50 mL conical tube.
	* Centrifuge at 9391*g. 4˚C for 3 minutes if processing in a 2 mL screw cap tubes.
12. Aspirate supernatant and re-suspend chromatin pellet in volume of 1X PBS + CPI required to maintain cell concentration below 25 M cells/mL.
	* For 15 or 50 mL conical processing, add 1X PBS + CPI by serological pipette and break pellet up with serological pipette.
	* For 2 mL screw cap tubes, use P1000 to re-suspend pellets in 1X PBS + CPI.
	* Pass the solution through a 25G needle into an appropriately-sized syringe 4 times (one pass=pulling into syringe, or pushing out of syringe).
13. Transfer samples to requisite number of 15 mL Falcon polystyrene tubes in 1 mL aliquots.
14. Sonicate a balanced carousel (6 polystyrene tubes) for 10 cycles, 30 seconds on/off.
15. After sonication is complete, transfer the chromatin into a fresh 15 or 50 mL conical,  or fresh 2 mL screw cap tubes.
	* To maximize recovery of solution, tilt 15 mL Falcon polystyrene tube and shake to get zirconia/silica beads to collect against side of tube.
	* Place P1000 pipette tip on bare area of bottom of tube and create a semi-seal where only liquid can get through the gap.
	* Return the tube to a perpendicular orientation to the ground and begin to aspirate the solution.
	* When finished, quickly remove the tip from the beads without moving thumb and transfer to new tube.
16. Once transfer is complete, remove 50 µL from each unique sample for a sonication check to be performed later.
17. Store sonicated chromatin and sonication check sample(s) at 4˚C.
	* Mammalian chromatin shown to be viable for up to 1 week at 4˚C.
18. Turn off all centrifuges and sonicators.
