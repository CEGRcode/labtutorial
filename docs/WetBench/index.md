This is an example file for a Docusaurus page under WetBench.

Each page should have the above header format with a unique `id`, `title` for display at the top of the page, and `sidebar_label` with the page's name to display in the sidebar. `sidebar_position` is an optional field to customize the order that each page should appear in.


You can add images from `labtutorial/docs/WetBench/images` like this:
