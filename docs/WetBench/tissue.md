## General Notes

***

All biological material is considered a biohazard until it has been crosslinked with formaldehyde. All waste (tips, paper towels, gloves) associated with tissue processing prior to crosslinking must be disposed of in biohazard waste bags and autoclaved after processing is complete.

All solutions and surfaces that made contact with biological material prior to crosslinking must be neutralized with 10% bleach (final concentration for solutions) in order for it to be poured down the sink. Solutions must incubate with 10% bleach for at least 30 minutes under a chemical hood before decanting. Surfaces must be wiped down with 10% bleach solution, followed by water, and then 70% ethanol.
