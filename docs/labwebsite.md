#### What is jekyll ?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

There are many static site generators available both free and paid. Each comes with its pros and cons. Choosing a particular generator is mostly based on user's technical knowledge, features, ease of deployment, programming (development) language and community support, used by large open-source projects, etc. Here are some other static site generators : [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [more](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

#### Why jekyll ?

GitHub is built partly using [Ruby-on-Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) web framework and Jekyll is natively supported by GitHub pages. The reason being both are based on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language. Jekyll uses ruby under the hood to process and generate the final static website. **You don't need to learn `ruby` in order to use `jekyll`.**

#### Install Jekyll

Install jekyll using these [docs ](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Highly recommend going through this [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) before making any changes to the lab website. This tutorial is helpful to understand the folder structure. Be a good programmer and rely on the official documentation for all use-cases.
