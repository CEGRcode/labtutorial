## Github set-up

You need to [make a Github account](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one. Please send your Github username to Olivia or Will so they can add you to the [CEGRcode Github organization](https://github.com/CEGRcode) so you can access the projects and private repos.

**Undergraduates:** Meetings and tasks will be managed through [Github projects](https://github.com/orgs/CEGRcode/projects/8) so please familiarize yourself with the structure.

**Everyone:** Strongly consider setting up [Github Desktop][github-desktop] and clone the recommended repos.
