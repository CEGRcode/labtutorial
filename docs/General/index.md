This site serves as a dynamic place for **technical documentation** and **checklists** for the Pugh lab. The goal is to preserve **consistency of workflows** to maximize **comparability of results** between lab members. There are a lot of details on best practices and lab standards throughout with an attempt to organize them by topic for better findability.

:::tip
Please let Olivia (or whoever is maintaining this site) if you have trouble finding anything or if you have suggestions for reorganizing the content for clarity. The markdown format of the site pages was intended to make it easier for lab members to update the documentation so feel free to draft something and then request the site maintainer to deploy your changes.
