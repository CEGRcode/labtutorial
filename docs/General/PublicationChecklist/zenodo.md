Similar to the rationale for the Github repo, we make the analysis and reference files available on Zenodo in a publication-specific repository to ensure the reproducibility of our findings. The difference is that Zenodo cannot be changed once submitted, gets a DOI, and can store large data files like BAM (unlike Github).
